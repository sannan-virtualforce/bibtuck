- messaging
  - someone should own this (you or me)
  - existing gem?

- email photos
  - what is the point of this feature? i suggest we don't implement?
  - we can use the ruby-gmail gem and a cron job to check for emails with an attachment.

- checkout
  - existing gem? they want a very vanilla process
  - was thinking we could propose a single-item checkout, since single-cart multi-vendor is a bitch. 
  - who manages shipping and transaction fees? if fixed, this makes life a lot easier.

- managing bucks
  - have a 'transactions' table with a delta/bucks field
  - sum of bucks field group by user_id is the balance
  - transactions have a reason code (purchase, refund, etc.)

- managing payments 
  - a 'payments' table with the payment_type, which is either shipping or transaction
  - do this with paypal express or paypal standard website?
