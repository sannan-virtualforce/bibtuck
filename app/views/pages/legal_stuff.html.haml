    %p 5.3 In order to access some features of the Site, you will have to create an account. Each member is only eligible for one account. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, whether it is done by you or not, so you must keep your login details and password secure.

  .title 6. THE ROLE OF BIB AND TUCK
  .content
    %p 6.1 YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT BIB AND TUCK IS NOT INVOLVED IN THE ACTUAL TRANSACTION BETWEEN BUYERS AND SELLERS. AS A RESULT, BIB AND TUCK HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE QUALITY, SAFETY OR LEGALITY OF ITEMS OR CONTENT POSTED BY MEMBERS ON OUR SITE, THE TRUTH OR ACCURACY OF LISTINGS, THE ABILITY OF SELLERS TO SELL ITEMS OR THE ABILITY OF BUYERS TO BUY ITEMS. WE CANNOT ENSURE AND DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT A MEMBER OR BROWSER OF OUR SITE WILL ACTUALLY COMPLETE A TRANSACTION OR ACT LAWFULLY IN USING OUR SITE.
    %p 6.2 When you enter into a transaction you create a legally binding contract with another member. You are responsible for ensuring that you comply with your obligations to that other member. If you do not, you may become liable to that member. You must ensure that you are aware of any laws relevant to you as a buyer or seller or laws for such other uses you make of our Site. If another member breaches any obligation to you, then you, and not Bib and Tuck, are responsible for enforcing any rights that you may have.
    %p 6.3 Except as specifically advised otherwise on our Site, Bib and Tuck does not offer any form of insurance or other buyer or seller protection which will assist you, because our Site merely provides the online venue for members to offer, sell, and buy items for Bucks and we are not otherwise involved in the transactions and interactions between buyers and sellers. Any disputes must be resolved between the buyer and the seller and we will only become involved as set out below.
    %p 6.4 Bib and Tuck cannot and does not confirm a member's purported identity. To assist, we have established a member-initiated rating system to help you evaluate the member you choose to deal with. We also encourage you to communicate directly with potential trading members through the tools available on our Site. Members agree to exercise their own caution in relation to the identity and reliability of other members.
    %p 6.5 Since Bib and Tuck is not involved in the actual transaction between buyers and sellers then to the extent permitted by law Bib and Tuck specifically disclaims all liability for any loss or damage, (actual, special, direct, indirect and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with your transaction.
    %p 6.6 Bib and Tuck, not being a party to the transaction, does not accept any liability in respect of your involvement in any mediation, arbitration, tribunal hearing, court proceeding or other proceedings (of whatever nature) with a buyer or a seller (as the case may be) in any way arising out of or in any way connected with your transaction. Bib and Tuck may plead these Terms of Use in bar to any claim, action, proceeding or suit brought by you, against Bib and Tuck for any matter arising out of any Bib and Tuck transaction or otherwise in respect of these Terms of Use. This clause does not affect any rights you may lawfully have against Bib and Tuck itself for its own acts or omissions.
    %p 6.7 We send you communications and notices regarding your transactions and your account on our Site. They do not represent any endorsement, guarantee or legitimization of your transactions. You are responsible for completing all transactions you participate in (including monitoring their status and complying with all relevant legal obligations). Other members sometimes provide us with information about a transaction. We do not control, endorse or approve this information by making it available to you. You may find information posted by other members to be offensive, harmful, inaccurate, or deceptive. Please use caution and common sense, and practice safe trading when using our Site. Please note that there are risks in using our Site, including dealing with under age persons or people acting under false pretenses. Additionally, there may be risks with international trading and dealing with foreign nationals.

  .title 7. LISTING AND SELLING
  .content
    %p 7.1 You must legally own and be able to sell any item you list for sale on our Site. The item must be in good condition (other than gentle wear and tear) and without defects. You must describe your item fully and accurately and include all terms of sale on the listing page of our Site. Your listings may only include text descriptions, pictures and other content relevant to the sale of that item, including any information that you are required to provide by any applicable law. The listing and the content of the listing, including, but not limited to, any photographs, must be your own work or work that you are legally entitled to use. All listed items must be listed in an appropriate category and all listing questions must be answered accurately and correctly.
    %p 7.2 When you list an item for sale on the Site you are offering the item described, for sale at the price indicated in Bucks. If you change your mind about selling the item you can ‘Unlist’ that item, in which case it is not available for another member to buy. But once your “For Sale” item has been purchased by another member the sale cannot be cancelled and you are legally bound to complete the sale and promptly deliver the item, by post or pickup, to the buyer. If you do not complete a transaction without lawful excuse you may be in breach of your obligations to both Bib and Tuck and the buyer and you may be liable, in addition to being attributed with a negative rating on the Site. You will be entitled to receive your Bucks as soon as the item is purchased, but Bib and Tuck reserves the right to remove the bucks if you do not lawfully complete the transaction. Your feedback rating as a seller will be indicative of your performance in relation to seller responsibilities on the Site.
    %p 7.3 Without limiting any other remedies available to Bib and Tuck at law, in equity or under this agreement, Bib and Tuck may, in its sole discretion, suspend or terminate your membership if we reasonably suspect or believe, or are informed by a government authority, that you (by conviction, settlement, insurance or escrow investigation, or otherwise in our sole discretion) have engaged or may engage in fraudulent activity using, or otherwise in connection with your use of, our Site, and you will have no claim whatsoever against Bib and Tuck in respect of any such suspension or termination of your membership.
    %p 7.4 You must not, by any means, infringe the rights (including intellectual property rights) of others. Examples of prohibited conduct include listing or selling ‘knock offs' and counterfeit items regardless of how you describe them. Bib and Tuck has a ‘no tolerance’ policy in regard to listing items that might infringe copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Where an alleged rights owner reports infringing items and asks Bib and Tuck to remove them, those items shall be removed forthwith without further investigation or any compensation for the seller.

  .title 8. BUYING
  .content
    %p 8.1 If you purchase an item you are obliged to complete the transaction with the seller, unless it is prohibited by law or by these Terms of Use. You cannot change your mind and rescind a purchase once you have elected to buy an item. You can however immediately resell the item on the Site. The purchase price in Bucks will be deducted from your Buck balance. If you have insufficient Bucks you can buy extra Bucks to complete the transaction. 

  .title 9. POSTAGE
  .content
    %p 9.1 Postage is a set price in real dollars determined by Bib and Tuck and is in addition to the price of the item paid in Bucks by the buyer. When a sale occurs, the buyer pays for the real cost of postage and Bib and Tuck then sends a pre-paid mailing label to the seller. 
    %p 9.2 It is the seller’s responsibility to mail the item promptly after it has been bought by the buyer. It is the buyer’s responsibility to specify delivery to an address where safe delivery can take place. The buyer's address notified to the seller is the address that the buyer stated as the shipping address when purchasing the item. Bib and Tuck is not responsible for providing an incorrect buyer’s address to a seller.

  .title 10. THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY - BUCKS
  .content
    %p 10.1 Bucks are the virtual currency of Bib and Tuck which operates like a small economy of its own. Each Buck is valued at USD$1. Bucks may not be redeemed or exchanged for cash nor may they be transferred to another member (other than by way of a purchase/sale transaction). Bucks do not constitute property of the member and are not transferable upon death, as part of a family law matter or otherwise by operation of law.
    %p 10.2 Bucks are intended to facilitate transactions on the Site and are not meant to be hoarded. Bucks shall expire if they are not used in a transaction within one year after their acquisition by a member. Members can spend their Bucks at any time while they are a member. If we terminate a person’s membership in accordance with the Terms of Use, that member will lose all Bucks standing to their credit.
    %p 10.3 Bucks are maintained for the benefit and participation of and are available to individual members only. Each member may maintain only one account. Bucks can only be transferred from one member to another member by undertaking a purchase / sale transaction. Bib and Tuck reserves the right to amend the amount of Bucks standing to a member’s credit pending the resolution of a transaction in dispute, in consequence of a breach of the Terms of Use or for any other reason deemed reasonable by Bib and Tuck.
    %p 10.4 Bib and Tuck reserves the right to issue bonus or top-up Bucks as promotional offers to members at large or selectively to certain Bib and Tuck members at any time, based upon account activity, geographic locations, membership participation or any other criteria determined at the sole discretion of Bib and Tuck. Bib and Tuck reserves the right to establish additional means of issuing Bucks including making Bucks available by way of a loan, to require loan repayment or to delete any or all of the means currently recognized, or to exclude specific types of transactions from the accumulation of Bucks.
    %p 10.5 Bucks are automatically allocated to a member’s account when they sell an item or when the member purchases Bucks for cash in order to complete a transaction. The sale of Bucks by Bib and Tuck to members is for the purpose of providing virtual currency finance to the members. The cash derived by Bib and Tuck on the sale of Bucks to members shall accumulate in a capital suspense account. In the event of winding up of the Site (without the transfer of the business to another Site) the monies from sale of Bucks may be applied firstly, to pay the operational expenses and secondly to defray the capital expenses of Bib and Tuck. The balance, if any, shall accrue to the members on winding up.

  .title 11. FEEDBACK
  .content
    %p 11.1 Feedback belongs to Bib and Tuck although we permit you to use it on our Site while you remain a member. You may not use it or deal with it in any way inconsistent with the Terms of Use, without our prior written permission. You acknowledge that we have no control over what members say about you and that we are not responsible for their ratings. But we ask all members to be fair and reasonable about their feedback on other members in order to maintain the integrity of the system.
    %p 11.2 You may not do (or omit to do) anything that may undermine the integrity of the feedback system. We are entitled to suspend or terminate your membership at any time if we, in our sole and absolute discretion, are concerned by any feedback about you, or your feedback rating or any feedback given by you.
    %p 11.3 You acknowledge that your feedback consists of ratings left by other members and a composite feedback score compiled by Bib and Tuck, and that the composite number without the relevant comments does not convey your full user profile. Because feedback ratings belong to Bib and Tuck and are not designed for any purpose other than facilitating trading between Bib and Tuck members, you may not use your Bib and Tuck feedback (including, but not limited to, marketing or exporting your rating or feedback comments) in any real or virtual venue other than a website operated by Bib and Tuck or its related and affiliated entities.
    %p 11.4 We do not provide the technical ability to allow you to import feedback from other websites to the Site because a composite score, without the corresponding feedback, does not reflect your true online reputation within our community.
    %p 11.5 Any feedback scores may be amended at any time in the absolute discretion of Bib and Tuck.

  .title 12. DISPUTES BETWEEN BUYERS & SELLERS
  .content
    %p 12.1 Action initiating a dispute should be taken as soon as possible after buying an item, if you are a buyer, or as soon as possible after shipping the item if you are a seller (the “Cause of Action”). At first instance it is the responsibility of the aggrieved member to the dispute to contact the other and work out a solution. Often problems arise because of a misunderstanding and can be resolved by subsequent clear communication. The members should agree on a reallocation of Bucks. If the dispute is still unresolved and the member has already ‘Requested a Buck Refund’ then the aggrieved member can contact Bib and Tuck no later than 60 days after the Cause of Action, and Bib and Tuck will be the final arbitrator of the matter. Factors taken into account by Bib and Tuck in resolving the dispute will be
    %ul.newline
      %li whether there is proof of postage
      %li whether the accused member responds to and communicates freely with the aggrieved member
      %li previous feedback scores of both members
      %li any other factors deemed relevant by Bib and Tuck.
    %p The decision of Bib and Tuck, in resolving the dispute, shall be final and binding on the respective members.

  .title 13. COMPLAINTS
  .content
    %p 13.1 If you have a complaint regarding the Site, you can contact us by email via the 'Contact us' page. We will deal with complaints as fast as we can.
    %p 13.2 Also you undertake to assist us to maintain the quality of the Site by bringing matters that do not reflect well on the service to our attention as soon as reasonably practical including potential breaches of these Terms of Use.

  .content
    %p 14.1 Bib and Tuck reserves the right:

In order to be a member of Bib and Tuck you must first read and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. As part of the normal operation of our services we collect, use, process and, in some cases, disclose information about you to third parties to facilitate your use of the Site. This Privacy Policy governs the information we collect about you and your use of information we provide to you. By accepting this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use agreement, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in the manner prescribed in this Privacy Policy.

  .title 3. Information We Collect
  .content
    %p 3.1 Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a streamlined, smooth, efficient, safe and customized trading experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs and to customize our services to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for this purpose and to achieve this goal.
    %p 3.2 To fully use our services, you will need to register using your real name, email address and password. On the Site members will be known by their own name to facilitate transparency and social networking. Additionally, your address will be disclosed to the seller as soon as you make a purchase.
    %p 3.3 We automatically track certain information about you based upon your behavior on our Site. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve you and our community. This information is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our Site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address.
    %p 3.4 We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of our Site. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customized services. We also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a "cookie". We also use "cookies" to allow you to enter login details less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information which is targeted to your interests. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our Site. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our Site and you may be required to re-enter your login details more frequently during a session.
    %p 3.5 Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of our Site that are placed by third parties. For example, if you view a web page created by a user, there may be a "cookie" placed within that web page. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.
    %p 3.6 If you choose to buy or sell on our Site, we collect information about your buying and selling behavior. We also collect other users' comments about you in our ratings syste.
    %p 3.7 If you choose to buy Bucks on our Site then we may collect some additional information such as your Paypal account details, credit card number, credit card expiry date and three digit security code.

  .title 4. How We Use Your Information
  .content
    %p 4.1 We use personal information about you (including but not limited to the information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site) to facilitate safe trading on the Site, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms of Use agreement. We may look at multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes and in particular we may peruse your information to identify users using multiple identities. We may also share your information with any related entities or affiliates, trading associates and joint venture partners to help coordinate the services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, prevent fraud and promote trust and safety and allow Bib and Tuck and these related entities and affiliates to provide better customer service to joint customers. By accepting this Privacy Policy you are consenting to the transfer of your personal information to the entities described in this section in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    %p 4.2 You agree that we may use personal information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and customize our Site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve our Site and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safer and customized experience while using our services.
    %p 4.3 You agree that we may use your information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the Site. By accepting the Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy you expressly agree to receive this information.

  .title 5. Disclosure of Your Information by Us
  .content
    %p 5.1 Although Bib and Tuck uses industry standard practices to protect your personal information, due to technical limitations, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we cannot and do not guarantee, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.
    %p 5.2 As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personal information about you to any third party. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed, and by agreeing to the Terms of Use including the Privacy Policy, you expressly agree that your personal information may be disclosed by Bib and Tuck in the following ways: Advertisers. We can aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personal information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we would not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally. Certain information, such as your name, email address, password, credit card number, and bank account number, would never be disclosed to advertisers. Throughout the Site, you are identified by your first and last name. This offers transparency in trading with members. As a result, other users and third parties might send you unsolicited messages and emails and be able to personally identify all of your activities on the Site. Other people can see some of your dealings, your rating and associated comments, your postings on the Site, and so on. External Service Providers. There may be a number of services offered by external service providers that help you use our Site (e.g., co-branded sites, authentication services, mediation facilities). If you choose to use such optional services, disclose personal information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect personal information about you, then their use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policy. We may, for your convenience, provide some of your personal information to the external service provider offering such services. However, before we disclose your personal information to an external service provider, you will have the opportunity to see what data is about to be sent and have the ability to approve the disclosure. To prevent our disclosure of your personal information to an external service provider, you can simply not use their services. Because we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to use their services. Internal Service Providers. We may use internal service providers to facilitate our services (e.g., search, discussion boards, surveys) and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to them. In some instances, the internal service provider may collect information directly from you (such as the situation where we ask an internal service provider to conduct a survey for us). In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider, and all information disclosures you make will be strictly optional. In all cases, these internal service providers' use of information we supply them is restricted by confidentiality agreements. If you provide additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your information is governed by their applicable privacy policy. Other Corporate Entities. We share much of our data, including personal information about you, with other entities committed to serving your online trading needs and related services, throughout the world, as allowed by applicable law. It is possible that Bib and Tuck could merge with or be acquired by another business entity. Should such an event occur, you should expect that Bib and Tuck would share some or all of your information in order to continue to provide the service. You will receive notice of such event (to the extent it occurs) and we will require that the new entity follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy. Legal Requests for Information. Bib and Tuck may lawfully disclose your personal information for law enforcement or regulatory purposes. Bib and Tuck cooperates with law enforcement enquires and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property and other rights. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other governmental officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, piracy or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.

  .title 6. Disclosure of Other Users' Information by You
  .content
    %p 6.1 In order to facilitate interaction among all Bib and Tuck members, our service allows you limited access to other users' contact information. As a seller you have access to the contact information of the buyer and as a buyer you have access to the profile information of the seller.
    %p 6.2 By entering into our Terms of Use agreement, you agree that, with respect to other users' personal information that you obtain through the Site or through a related communication or transaction, Bib and Tuck grants to you a license to use such information only for facilitating the trading transaction and related matters.
    %p 6.3 Under no circumstances, except as defined in this Section, can you disclose personal information about another user to any third party without our consent and the consent of such other user after adequate disclosure.
    %p 6.4 We and our users do not tolerate spam. Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you are not licensed to add a Bib and Tuck user, even a user who has purchased an item from you, to your mail list (email or physical mail) without their express consent after adequate disclosure.

  .title 7. Using Email Tools
  .content
    %p 7.1 You may not use any email forwarding services that we offer to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our Terms of Use agreement or Privacy Policy. If you forward an email through our services we do nothing other than send the email. We do not rent or sell these email addresses. We do not permanently store the email messages or the email addresses.

  .title 8. Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information
  .content
    %p 8.1 In “My Account” you must promptly update your personal information if it changes. Once posted, you cannot change or remove any public postings made in our message areas or the ratings area.
    %p 8.2 Upon your request, we will deactivate your account, contact information, and financial information from our active databases. We will retain in our files information you have requested us to remove in some circumstances, such as to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, and enforce our Terms of Use agreement, and to comply with legal requirements. Furthermore, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. However, such information will be deactivated from public viewing and usage by other members of Bib and Tuck  and will only be available to select Bib and Tuck  personnel.

  .title 9. Other Information Collectors
  .content
    %p 9.1 Except as otherwise expressly discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are buyers or sellers on our Site or other sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers (if any), they adhere to their own privacy customs and policies. Since Bib and Tuck does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

  .title 10. Security
  .content
    %p 10.1 Your Information is stored on Bib and Tuck’s server located in the United States. We use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet and the user acknowledges this risk.

  .title 11. Notice
